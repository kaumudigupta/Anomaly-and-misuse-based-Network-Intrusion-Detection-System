# Anomaly-and-misuse-based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
The use of information and technology by different types of devices generates a large quantity of data packets that contains confidential and personal information.
The packets are used to send data over an network. Hackers try to manipulate our data or gain illegal access to the files. 
Due to this reason, it is necessary to use computer security tools, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). 
This work presents an IDS that can perform the packet-based analysis. The flows are organized to be processed by machine learning methods.
We design a network intrusion detection system that alarms the admin in case of any kind of intrusion or misuse of data.
We are implementing this system using Support vector machine(SVM) algorithm, Weka and Java in various stages to overcome the challenges.
Various shortcomings like Misuse of data, port scanning, denial of services will be dealt with in this system. 
Training data will be used to train the network and perform the testing of the system.
